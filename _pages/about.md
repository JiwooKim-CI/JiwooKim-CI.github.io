# About me
Hello, Iâ€™m Jiwoo Kim, a first-year Ph.D. student in Human Development at Cornell University, working with Professor Felix Thoemmes. I focus on quantitative research methods, especially causal inference in the social science field. For causal inference research, I use both the potential outcome approach and graphical approach. 

My interest in causal inference stems from observed disparities between research intentions and findings. Many researchers avoid discussing causal relationships, even when their questions assume causality, prompting me to believe that adopting a causal perspective is imperative to answer their research question appropriately.

Therefore, I am delving deeper into the study of measuring causality in the social science field by conducting multiple research projects. Specifically, I am working on a paper about measuring inequality using causal restrictions of instrumental variable, and I am also writing a paper about the current state or flaws of conducting causal mediation analysis in the field of social psychology.
